**OVERVIEW**
Here lies all of the TRAINING & TEST IMAGES within their corresponding labeled folder. For example, if there are a bunch of photos showing only glass objects, all of these images should be placed into their own folder named 'glass' which corresponds to the class 'glass'. Equivalently for photos showing only paper, metal, plastic, etc. In the future, there will be a .zip file where you can export all images within their corresponding labeled folders into this 'TRAINING & TEST IMAGES' folder.
